##  Features

-  **Infrastructure provisioning** via Terraform
-  **EC2 Ubuntu server** for app hosting
-  **RDS MySQL** database for storing game scores
-  **Daily database backups** to S3 using systemd timers
-  **Dockerized frontend and backend**
-  **Ansible automation** to install Docker, deploy containers, and configure system services
-  **Nginx reverse proxy** to expose the app cleanly on port 80

---

## How to deploy?

-   **git clone**
-   **cd terraform**
-   **terraform init**
-   **terraform apply**
This will:

    ðŸ”¸ Create an EC2 instance (Ubuntu)

    ðŸ”¸ Launch an RDS MySQL database

    ðŸ”¸ Create an S3 bucket for backups

    ðŸ”¸ Generate and import an SSH key

    ðŸ”¸ Output values such as the public IP, RDS endpoint, and S3 bucket name
3. Update Ansible Variables:
    - **ansible/inventory.ini** Update the EC2 IP address from Terraform output
    - **ansible/docker-compose.yml** Update environment variables for the backend container using Terraform outputs:
 4. Run Ansible Playbook:
    -   cd ../ansible
    - ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
    This will:

    Install Docker + Docker Compose on the EC2 server

    Deploy the frontend and backend containers

    Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy

    Copy the backup script

    Register a systemd timer to back up your DB to S3 daily

5. Access Your App:
    - Open a browser and go to:
    **http://<your-ec2-public-ip>**
